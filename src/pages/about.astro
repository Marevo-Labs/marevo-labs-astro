        To access certain features of Foxi, you must create a user account.
        During registration, you agree to provide accurate and complete
        information. This information helps us serve you better and ensures the

          This section outlines the limitations of our liability regarding the
          use of Foxi services. Understanding these limitations helps you know
          the extent of our responsibilities and your rights.

    <div class="space-y-4">
      <h4 class="text-xl font-gotham uppercase">General Limitations</h4>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
        Foxi is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis. We do not
        warrant that the service will be uninterrupted, error-free, or
        completely secure. We disclaim all warranties, whether express or
        implied, including but not limited to the implied warranties of
        merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
        We are not liable for any damages resulting from the use or inability to
        use our services, including but not limited to direct, indirect,
        incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages. This includes
        damages for loss of profits, data, or other intangibles.
      </p>

      <h4 class="text-xl font-gotham uppercase">Third-Party Services</h4>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
        Foxi may include links to third-party websites or services that are not
        owned or controlled by us. We do not endorse or assume any
        responsibility for any such third-party sites, information, materials,
        products, or services. Accessing and using these third-party services is
        at your own risk.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
        We are not liable for any loss or damage incurred as a result of any
        dealings with third-party websites or services, including the sharing of
        your information with such third parties. It is your responsibility to
        review the terms and conditions and privacy policies of any third-party
        websites or services you use.
      </p>

      <h4 class="text-xl font-gotham uppercase">Maximum Liability</h4>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
        In no event shall our total liability to you for all claims arising out
        of or relating to the use of or inability to use the service exceed the
        amount paid by you, if any, for accessing Foxi during the twelve (12)
        months immediately preceding the date of the claim. This limitation
        applies regardless of the form or source of the claim or loss, whether
        such liability arises out of any claim based upon contract, warranty,
        tort, or otherwise.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
        Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability
        for consequential or incidental damages, so the above limitation may not
        apply to you. In such cases, our liability will be limited to the
        fullest extent permitted by applicable law.
